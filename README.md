## Paf-Project_Social-Media-App

We designed and implemented a comprehensive social media platform for food enthusiasts using Spring Boot and React. Our REST API, secured with OAuth2, supports robust functionality including user profiles, posts with photos, likes, comments, and follower relationships. The intuitive client web application, built with React, ensures a user-friendly experience for non-technical users. The API is designed for scalability and is compatible with mobile applications. Our team employed best practices, including GitHub Workflow for version control, to deliver a secure, stable, and maintainable platform. This project showcases our expertise in full-stack development and modern web technologies.
